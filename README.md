# Hyperion (Solar Panel) Sensor Software

This repository contains the HAL for testing on a TMS570LS1224 MCU.

The sensor API (along with the ceedling test framework) lives in /sensor_software

## Ceedling 
[Ceedling](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling) is the unit testing framework used for this task. 


After [installing ceedling](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling) on your system, to run the ceedling tests, cd into 'sensor_software/' and run:
```
ceedling test
```

NOTE: This is still a work-in-progress.
